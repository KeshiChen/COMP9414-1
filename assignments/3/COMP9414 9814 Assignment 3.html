<h3 align="center">Project 3</h3>
<p align="center">
Due: Sunday 2 June, 11:59 pm
<br align="center">
Marks: 12% of final assessment
</p><p>
For this project, you must choose ONE of the following TWO options:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><b><a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/13s1/hw3/hw3prolog">Prolog</a></b><a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/13s1/hw3/hw3prolog">
(BDI Agent)</a>
<p>
This option involves implementing the basic functions,
in Prolog, of a simple BDI agent operating in a Gridworld environment,
picking up junk and collecting rewards along the way.
</p><p>
</p></li><li><b><a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/13s1/hw3/hw3rogue">Rogue</a></b><a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/13s1/hw3/hw3rogue">
(Text-Based Adventure Game)</a>
<p>
This option involves implementing an agent to play a simple text-based
adventure game, in a language of your choosing.
The agent is required to move around a rectangular
environment, collecting tools and avoiding (or removing)
obstacles along the way.

</p></li></ol>

<p>
</p><h4>Groups</h4>
<p>
This assignment may be done individually, or in groups of two
students. Each group should send an email to <code>blair@cse</code>
by Sunday 19 May, indicating which option you have chosen,
and the names of the group members
(or just your name, if you intend to do the assignment individually).
</p><p>
</p><h4>Submission</h4>
<p>
Once submissions are open, you should submit using one of these
commands (depending on which option you have chosen):
</p><ol>
<li><b>Prolog</b> (BDI agent)
<pre>give cs9414 hw3prolog agent.pro
</pre>

</li><li><b>Rogue</b> (Text-Based Adventure Game)
<pre>give cs9414 hw3rogue Makefile ...
</pre>
</li></ol>
<p>
Only one member of the group needs to submit.
You can submit as many times as you like - later submissions
will overwrite earlier ones
(and submissions by one group member will overwrite
those of the other).
You can check that your submission
has been received by using the following command:
</p><p>
<tt>9414 classrun -check</tt>
</p><p>
The submission deadline is Sunday 2 June, 11:59 pm.<br>
15% penalty will be applied to the (maximum) mark
for every 24 hours late after the deadline.
</p><p>
You should always adhere to good coding practices and style.
In general, a program that attempts a substantial
part of the job but does that part correctly
will receive more marks than one attempting to do
the entire job but with many errors.
</p><p>
Additional information may be found in the
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/13s1/hw3/faq.shtml">FAQ</a>
and will be considered as part of the specification for the project.
</p><p>
Questions relating to the project can also be posted to the
MessageBoard on the course Web page.
If you have a question that has not already been answered on the FAQ
or the MessageBoard, you can email it to your tutor, or to
<code>blair@cse</code>
</p><p>
</p><h4>Plagiarism Policy</h4>
<p>
Your program must be entirely your own work.
Plagiarism detection software will be used to compare all submissions pairwise
(as well as submissions for similar assignments from previous years, if appropriate)
and serious penalties will be applied, particularly in the case
of repeat offences.
</p><p>
<b>DO NOT COPY FROM OTHERS; DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO SEE YOUR CODE</b>
</p><p>
Please refer to the
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/people/studentoffice/policies/yellowform.html">Yellow Form</a>,
or to section on
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/help/doc/primer/node42.html">Originality of Assignment Submissions</a>
in the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/help/doc/primer/index.html">Unix Primer</a>,
as well as the
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~chak/plagiarism/plagiarism-guide.html">CSE Addendum
to the UNSW Plagiarism Policy</a>
if you require further clarification on this matter.
</p><p>
</p><p>
Good luck!
