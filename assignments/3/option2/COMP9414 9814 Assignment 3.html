Marks: 12% of final assessment
</p><p>
</p><p>
For this project you will be implementing an agent to play a simple text-based
adventure game. The agent is required to move around a rectangular
environment, collecting tools and avoiding (or removing)
obstacles along the way.
The obstacles and tools within the environment are represented as follows:
</p><p>
<strong><u>Obstacles</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Tools</u></strong>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><tt>T</tt>&nbsp;</td><td>tree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><tt>a</tt>&nbsp;</td><td>axe</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>-</tt></td><td>door</td><td><tt>k</tt></td><td>key</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>*</tt></td><td>wall</td><td><tt>d</tt></td><td>dynamite</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>~</tt></td><td>water</td><td><tt>g</tt></td><td>gold</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
The agent will be represented by one of the characters
<tt>^, v, <code>&lt;</code></tt>&nbsp; or&nbsp; <tt><code>&gt;</code>,</tt>
depending on which direction it is pointing.
The agent is capable of the following instructions:
</p><p>
<tt>L</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; turn left<br>
<tt>R</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; turn right<br>
<tt>F</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (try to) move forward<br>
<tt>C</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (try to) chop down a tree, using an axe<br>
<tt>O</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (try to) open a door, using a key<br>
<tt>B</tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; (try to) blast a wall, door or tree, using dynamite
</p><p>
When it executes an <tt>L</tt> or <tt>R</tt> instruction,
the agent remains in the same location and only its
direction changes.
When it executes an <tt>F</tt> instruction,
the agent attempts to move a single step in whichever direction it is pointing.
The <tt>F</tt> instruction will fail (have no effect)
if there is a wall, tree or door directly in front of the agent;
if the agent moves forward into the water, it will fall in and drown.
</p><p> 
When the agent moves to a location occupied by a tool,
it automatically picks up the tool.
The agent may use a <tt>C</tt>, <tt>O</tt> or <tt>B</tt> instruction
to remove an obstacle immediately in front of it,
if it is carrying the appropriate tool.
A tree may be removed with a <tt>C</tt> (chop) instruction, if an axe is held.
A door may be removed with an <tt>O</tt> (open) instruction, if a key is held.
A wall, tree or door may be removed with a <tt>B</tt> (blast) instruction,
if dynamite is held.
</p><p>
To win the game, the agent must pick up the gold and
then return to its initial location.
</p><p>
<b>Running as a Single Process</b>
</p><p>
Copy the archive <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/13s1/hw3/hw3rogue/src.zip"><tt>src.zip</tt></a> into your own filespace and unzip it.
Then type
</p><pre>cd src
javac *.java
java Rogue -i s0.in
</pre>
You should then see something like this:
<pre>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~     T     T   k ~~
~~   ***     ***   ~~
~~*-*     v     *-*~~
~~  **         **  ~~
~~ g **   d   ** a ~~
~~    TT     TT    ~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Enter Action(s): 
</pre>
This allows you to play the role of the agent by typing
commands at the keyboard (followed by &lt;Enter&gt;).
Note:
<ul>
<li>a key can be used to open any door;
once a door is opened, it has effectively been removed from the environment
and can never be "closed" again.
</li><li>an axe or key can be used multiple times,
but each dynamite can be used only once.
</li><li>
<tt>C</tt>, <tt>O</tt> or <tt>B</tt> instructions will fail
(have no effect) if the appropriate tool is not held,
or if the location immediately in front of the agent
does not contain an appropriate obstacle.
</li></ul>
<p>
<b>Running in Network Mode</b>
</p><p>
Follow these instructions to see how the game runs in
network mode:
</p><ol>
<li>
open two windows, and <tt>cd</tt> to the <tt>src</tt> directory in
both of them.
</li><li> choose a port number between 1025 and 65535 - let's suppose you choose
31415.
</li><li>
type this in one window:
<pre>java Rogue -p 31415 -i s0.in
</pre>
</li><li>
type this in the other window:
<pre>java Agent -p 31415
</pre>
</li></ol>
In network mode, the agent runs as a separate process
and communicates with the game engine through a TCPIP socket.
Notice that the agent cannot see the whole environment,
but only a 5-by-5 "window" around its current location,
appropriately rotated.
We have also provided a C version of the agent,
which you can run by typing
<pre>make
./agent -p 31415
</pre>

<p>
<b>Writing an Agent</b>
</p><p>
At each time step, the environment will send a series of 24
characters to the agent, constituting a scan of the
5-by-5 window it is currently seeing;
the agent must send back a
single character to indicate the action it has chosen.
</p><p>
You are free to write the agent in any language you choose.
If you are writing in Java, your main file should be called
<code>Agent.java</code> (you are free to use the supplied file
<code>Agent.java</code> as a starting point).
If you are writing in C,
you are free to use the files <code>agent.c</code>, <code>pipe.c</code>
and <code>pipe.h</code> as a starting point.
In other languages, you will have to write the socket code
for yourself.
You must include a <code>Makefile</code> with your submission,
producing an executable called <code>agent</code>.
</p><p>
You may assume that the environment is no larger than 80 by 80,
and that it is totally surrounded by water,
so there is no confusion about where the environment begins and ends.
</p><p>
Additional examples of input and output files will be
provided in the <tt><a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9414/13s1/hw3/hw3rogue/sample">sample</a></tt> directory.
</p><p>
<b>Question</b>
</p><p>
At the top of your code, in a block of comments,
you must provide a brief answer (one or two paragraphs)
to this Question:
</p><blockquote>
Briefly describe how your program works, including any algorithms
and data structures employed, and explain any design decisions
you made along the way.
</blockquote>

<h4>Assessment</h4>

Your program will be tested on a series of sample inputs
with successively more challenging environments.
There will be:
<ul>
<li>8 marks for functionality (automarking)
</li><li>4 marks for Algorithms, Style, Comments and answer to the Question
</li></ul>

<h4>Submission</h4>

When submissions are open, you should submit by typing
<pre>give cs9414 hw3rogue Makefile ...
</pre>
<p>
Please ensure that you submit the source files and NOT any binary files.
The <code>give</code> system will compile your program using your
<code>Makefile</code> and check that it produces a binary file
(or java class files) with the correct name.
