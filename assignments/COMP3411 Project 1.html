<h3>Specification</h3>

In this assignment, you are to write Prolog procedures to
perform some list and tree operations. The aim of the assignment is to give you
experience with typical Prolog programming techniques.
<p>

</p><p>
At the start of your program,  place a comment containing
<b>your full name, student number and assignment name</b>.
You may add additional information like the date the program was completed, etc.
if you wish.
</p>

<p>
At the start of each Prolog predicate that you write, write a comment
describing the overall function of the predicate.
</p>

<p>Advice on the use of comments and meaningful identifiers in Prolog
can be found under 
<a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/%7Ebillw/prologdict.html#comment">comments</a>
in the <a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/%7Ebillw/prologdict.html">Prolog
Dictionary</a>.
</p>

<hr>
<h3>Testing Your Code</h3>
<p>
A significant part of completing this assignment will be
testing the code you write to make sure that it works correctly. To do this, you
will need to design test cases that exercise every part of the code.
</p>
<p>
You should pay particular attention to "boundary cases", that is,
what happens when the data you are testing with is very small, or in
some way special. For example:

</p><ul>
<li> What happens when the list you input has no members, or only one member?
</li><li> Does you code work for lists with both even and odd numbers of members?
</li><li> Does your code work for negative numbers?
</li></ul>

Note: not all of these matter in all cases, so
for example with <code>log_table</code>, negative numbers don't have
logs, so it doesn't make sense to ask whether your code works with
negative numbers or zero.
<p>
With each question, some example test data are provided to clarify
what the code is intended to do. You need to design <i>further</i> test data.
Testing, and designing test cases, is part of the total programming task.
If you are unsure what your code is supposed to do in a particular
case, don't guess - ask! E-mail to the lecturer is often the most
convenient way.
</p>

<h3>COMP9814-only Questions</h3>

<p>Questions marked <b>COMP9814 only</b> need only be answered by students
enrolled in COMP9814. (Students enrolled in COMP9414 are welcome and
encouraged to solve these problems but their solutions will not be
assessed.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>It is important to use <u>exactly</u> the names given below
for your predicates, otherwise the automated testing procedure will
not be able to find your predicates and you will lose marks. Even the
capitalisation of your predicate names must be as given below.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>

<hr>
<ol start="1">

<li>Write a predicate <code>sumsq_div3or5(Numbers, Sum)</code> that sums the
squares of only the numbers that are divisible by 5 or by 3,
in a list of non-negative whole numbers.  <i>Example:</i>
<pre>?- sumsq_div3or5([1,3,5,2,4,6,8,7,12], Result).

Result = 214 ;
fail.

</pre>
That's 3×3 + 5×5 + 6×6 + 12×12.

<p>
Note that it is the element of the list, not its position, that should
be tested for divisibility by 3 or 5.
Think carefully about how the predicate should behave on
the <i>empty</i> list — should it fail or is there a reasonable value
that <code>Sum</code> can be bound to?
</p>

<p>
In order to decide whether a number is divisible by 3 or 5, you can use the
built-in Prolog operator <code>N mod M</code>, which computes the remainder
after dividing  the whole number <code>N</code> by the whole number
<code>M</code>. Thus for example a number <code>N</code> is divisible by 3 if the goal
<code>0 is N mod 3</code> succeeds. Remember that arithmetic expressions
like <code>X + 1</code> and <code>N mod M</code> are only evaluated,
in Prolog, if they appear <i>after</i> the <code>is</code> operator. So 
<code>0 is N mod 3</code> works, but <code>N mod 3 is 0</code> doesn't work.
</p>
</li></ol>

<hr>
<ol start="2">
<p>
</p><li> For the purposes of the examples in this question, assume that the
following facts have been loaded into Prolog:

<pre>gives(john, mary, pear).
gives(mary, john, book(rowling, "Deathly Hallows")).
gives(fred, mark, cold).
gives(jane, paul, help).
gives(paul, jane, thanks).
gives(eric, eric, guitar).
gives(phil, andy, kick).
gives(andy, phil, kick).
gives(joe, joe, punch).
gives(joe, joe, whack).
</pre>

<b>NOTE:</b> do <i>not</i> include these in your solution file.
<p></p>

<p>
Write a predicate <code>givers(Giver1, Giver2)</code> that succeeds if
<code>Giver1</code> and <code>Giver2</code> both give each other
something, but not the same thing.  <code>Giver1</code> and
<code>Giver2</code> must be different from each other.

</p><pre>?- givers(john, mary).
true.

?- givers(Person1, Person2).
Person1 = john,
Person2 = mary ;
Person1 = mary,
Person2 = john ;
Person1 = jane,
Person2 = paul ;
Person1 = paul,
Person2 = jane ;
fail.

?- 
</pre>
<a name="note1">
<p>
Note that your <code>givers</code> predicate will be tested with
different <code>gives(Who, ToWhom, What)</code> facts to those in the
example.
</p>
</a></li></ol><a name="note1">

<hr>
</a><ol start="3"><a name="note1">
<p>
</p></a><li><a name="note1"> Write a predicate <code>log_table(NumberList, ResultList)</code>
that binds <code>ResultList</code> to the list of pairs consisting
of a number and its log, for each number in <code>NumberList</code>.
For example:
<pre>?- log_table([1,4.4817,12.1825], Result).
Result = [[1, 0.0], [4.4817, 1.5], [12.1825, 2.5]].

</pre>
Note that the Prolog built-in function <code>log</code> computes the 
natural logarithm, and that it needs to be evaluated using
<code>is</code> to actually compute the log:

<pre>?- X is log(4.4817).
X = 1.5.

?- X = log(4.4817).
X = log(4.4817).

</pre>
<p></p>

<hr>
<p><b>COMP9814 only:</b> write a predicate
<code>function_table(+NumList, +Function, -ResultList)</code>
that binds <code>ResultList</code> to the list of pairs consisting
of a number X and Function(X), for each number in NumList.
For example:
</p><pre>?- function_table([0, 0.25, 1.5708], sin, Result).

Result = [[0, 0.0], [0.25, 0.247404], [1.5708, 1.0]] ;

false.
</pre>
Hint: look up <code>univ</code> or <code>=..</code> in the
</a><a href="http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/%7Ebillw/dictionaries/prolog">Prolog Dictionary</a>.
</li></ol>

<hr>
<ol start="4">
<p>
</p><li> Write a predicate <code>chop_down(List, NewList)</code>
that binds <code>NewList</code> to <code>List</code> with all sequences of
<i>successive decreasing</i> whole numbers replaced by the last number in
the sequence.  An example of successive decreasing whole numbers is:
<code>22, 21, 20, 19</code>. (Note that the numbers have to be <i>successive</i>
in the sense of decreasing by exactly 1 at each step.)
For example:
<pre>?- <i>chop_down([1, 3, 7, 6, 5, 10, 9], Result).</i>
Result = [1, 3, 5, 9] ;
false.
?- <i>chop_down([6, 4, 10, 9], Result).</i>
Result = [6, 4, 9] ;
false.
</pre>
In this example, the sequence <code>7, 6, 5</code> has been replaced
by <code>5</code>, and <code>10, 9</code> has been replaced by <code>9</code>.
</li></ol>

<hr>
<ol start="5">

<p>
</p><li> For this question we consider binary expression-trees
whose leaves are either of the form
<code>tree(empty, Num, empty)</code> where <code>Num</code> is a number, or
<code>tree(empty, z, empty)</code> in which case we will think of
the letter <code>z</code> as a kind of "variable".
Every tree is either a leaf or of the form
<code>tree(L, Op, R)</code> where <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> are the
left and right subtrees, and <code>Op</code> is one of the arithmetic operators
<code>'+'</code>, <code>'-'</code>, <code>'*'</code>, <code>'/'</code>
(signifying addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).
<p>
Write a predicate <code>tree_eval(Value, Tree, Eval)</code> that binds
<code>Eval</code> to the result of evaluating the expression-tree <code>Tree</code>,
with the variable <code>z</code> set equal to the specified <code>Value</code>.
For example:
</p>

<pre>?- tree_eval(2, tree(tree(empty,z,empty),
                 '+',tree(tree(empty,1,empty),
                      '/',tree(empty,z,empty))), Eval).
Eval = 2.5 ;
false.

?- tree_eval(5, tree(tree(empty,z,empty),
                 '+',tree(tree(empty,1,empty),
                      '/',tree(empty,z,empty))), Eval).
Eval = 5.2 ;
false.

<p>
<b>COMP9814 only:</b>
The <b>height</b> of a binary tree is defined to be the
number of nodes in the longest path from the root to a leaf.
A binary tree is called <b>balanced</b> if, for every node in the tree,
the height of its left and right subtree differ by no more than 1.
For example, the tree on the left is balanced, with height 4, but the tree on the
right is not balanced, because the left and right subtree of node 4
have heights 0 and 2, respectively.

</p><p>
<b>COMP9814 only:</b>
Write a predicate <code>height_if_balanced(Tree, HiB)</code>,
which takes a binary tree <code>Tree</code> and binds its second
argument <code>HiB</code> to the height of the Tree,
if it is balanced, or -1 if it is <b>not</b> balanced.
</p><p>
Trees are represented as either <code>empty</code> or
<code>tree(L, Data, R)</code>, where <code>L</code> and <code>R</code>
are the left and right subtrees.
The <code>Data</code> in each node of the tree is irrelevant to
this programming exercise.

You are free to copy the predicate <code>max(First, Second, Max)</code>
from the lecture notes and use it in your program.

<code>Tree</code> must be instantiated at the time of the call.
These examples use the trees shown above:

</p><pre>?- height_if_balanced(tree(tree(tree(empty,1,empty),2,empty),
                        3, tree(tree(empty,4,empty),
                             5, tree(empty,6,tree(empty,7,empty)))),HiB).
HiB = 4 ;
false.

?- height_if_balanced(tree(tree(tree(empty,1,empty),2,empty),
                         3, tree(empty,4,tree(tree(empty,5,empty),
                                           6, tree(empty,7,empty)))),HiB).
HiB = -1 ;
false.
